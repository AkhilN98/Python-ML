# SF Salaries Exercise 

Welcome to a quick exercise for you to practice your pandas skills! We will be using the [SF Salaries Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/sf-salaries) from Kaggle! Just follow along and complete the tasks outlined in bold below. The tasks will get harder and harder as you go along.


** Import pandas as pd.**

```{python}
import pandas as pd
```

** Read Salaries.csv as a dataframe called sal.**

```{python}
sal = pd.read_csv('Salaries.csv')
```

** Check the head of the DataFrame. **

```{python}
sal.head()
```

** Use the .info() method to find out how many entries there are.**

```{python}
sal.info()
```

**What is the average BasePay ?**

```{python}
sal['BasePay'].mean()
```

** What is the highest amount of OvertimePay in the dataset ? **

```{python}
sal['OvertimePay'].max()
```

** What is the job title of  JOSEPH DRISCOLL ? Note: Use all caps, otherwise you may get an answer that doesn't match up (there is also a lowercase Joseph Driscoll). **

```{python}
filt = sal['EmployeeName'] == 'JOSEPH DRISCOLL'
sal[filt]['JobTitle']
```

** How much does JOSEPH DRISCOLL make (including benefits)? **

```{python}
filt = sal['EmployeeName'] == 'JOSEPH DRISCOLL'
sal[filt]['TotalPayBenefits']
```

** What is the name of highest paid person (including benefits)?**

```{python}
sal[sal['TotalPayBenefits'] == sal['TotalPayBenefits'].max()]
```

** What is the name of lowest paid person (including benefits)? Do you notice something strange about how much he or she is paid?**

```{python}
sal[sal['TotalPayBenefits'] == sal['TotalPayBenefits'].min()]
```

** What was the average (mean) BasePay of all employees per year? (2011-2014) ? **

```{python}
#sal['BasePay'].mean()
year_grp = sal.groupby('Year')
year_grp['BasePay'].mean()
```

** How many unique job titles are there? **

```{python}
sal['JobTitle'].nunique()
```

** What are the top 5 most common jobs? **

```{python}
sal['JobTitle'].value_counts().head(5)
```

** How many Job Titles were represented by only one person in 2013? (e.g. Job Titles with only one occurence in 2013?) **

```{python}
sum(sal[sal['Year'] == 2013]['JobTitle'].value_counts() == 1)
```

** How many people have the word Chief in their job title? (This is pretty tricky) **

```{python}
def is_Cheif(title):
    if 'chief' in title.lower().split():
        return True
    else:
        return False
sum(sal['JobTitle'].apply(lambda x: is_Cheif(x)))
```

** Bonus: Is there a correlation between length of the Job Title string and Salary? **

```{python}

```

```{python}

```

# Great Job!
