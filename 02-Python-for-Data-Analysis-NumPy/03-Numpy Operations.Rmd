# NumPy Operations


## Arithmetic

You can easily perform array with array arithmetic, or scalar with array arithmetic. Let's see some examples:

```{python}
import numpy as np
arr = np.arange(0,10)
```

```{python}
arr + arr
```

```{python}
arr * arr
```

```{python}
arr - arr
```

```{python}
# Warning on division by zero, but not an error!
# Just replaced with nan
arr/arr
```

```{python}
# Also warning, but not an error instead infinity
1/arr
```

```{python}
arr**3
```

## Universal Array Functions

Numpy comes with many [universal array functions](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/ufuncs.html), which are essentially just mathematical operations you can use to perform the operation across the array. Let's show some common ones:

```{python}
#Taking Square Roots
np.sqrt(arr)
```

```{python}
#Calcualting exponential (e^)
np.exp(arr)
```

```{python}
np.max(arr) #same as arr.max()
```

```{python}
np.sin(arr)
```

```{python}
np.log(arr)
```

# Great Job!

That's all we need to know for now!
