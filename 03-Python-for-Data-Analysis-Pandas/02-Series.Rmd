# Series


The first main data type we will learn about for pandas is the Series data type. Let's import Pandas and explore the Series object.

A Series is very similar to a NumPy array (in fact it is built on top of the NumPy array object). What differentiates the NumPy array from a Series, is that a Series can have axis labels, meaning it can be indexed by a label, instead of just a number location. It also doesn't need to hold numeric data, it can hold any arbitrary Python Object.

Let's explore this concept through some examples:

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

### Creating a Series

You can convert a list,numpy array, or dictionary to a Series:

```{python}
labels = ['a','b','c']
my_list = [10,20,30]
arr = np.array([10,20,30])
d = {'a':10,'b':20,'c':30}
```

** Using Lists**

```{python}
pd.Series(data=my_list)
```

```{python}
pd.Series(data=my_list,index=labels)
```

```{python}
pd.Series(my_list,labels)
```

** NumPy Arrays **

```{python}
pd.Series(arr)
```

```{python}
pd.Series(arr,labels)
```

** Dictionary**

```{python}
pd.Series(d)
```

### Data in a Series

A pandas Series can hold a variety of object types:

```{python}
pd.Series(data=labels)
```

```{python}
# Even functions (although unlikely that you will use this)
pd.Series([sum,print,len])
```

## Using an Index

The key to using a Series is understanding its index. Pandas makes use of these index names or numbers by allowing for fast look ups of information (works like a hash table or dictionary).

Let's see some examples of how to grab information from a Series. Let us create two sereis, ser1 and ser2:

```{python}
ser1 = pd.Series([1,2,3,4],index = ['USA', 'Germany','USSR', 'Japan'])                                   
```

```{python}
ser1
```

```{python}
ser2 = pd.Series([1,2,5,4],index = ['USA', 'Germany','Italy', 'Japan'])                                   
```

```{python}
ser2
```

```{python}
ser1['USA']
```

Operations are then also done based off of index:

```{python}
ser1 + ser2
```

Let's stop here for now and move on to DataFrames, which will expand on the concept of Series!
# Great Job!
